# PetAppMongoTests
---------Instructions how to start and run unit tests---------

In our project we implement default MongoRepository in repositories, so it is not necessary to test them.

We only testing our business logic layer. Here we testing AuthService and CommentService.

There are many ways to start tests, but the easiest way is to go to directory:

src/test/java/com/petapp/service/AuthServiceTest.java 
for testing AuthServiceTest

src/test/java/com/petapp/service/CommentServiceTest.java
for testing CommentServiceTest

to start tests you should find line " class AuthServiceTest { "

and click on the button to the left of the line 

or 

just press the combination - Â Ctrl+Shift+F10


the same for CommentServiceTest.
